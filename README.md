Sticky Alphabet Index for Android
===========================

This fork is based on the code from [timehop](https://github.com/timehop/sticky-headers-recyclerview). Although, instead of sticky headers, this implementation is a replica of the native Android contacts app, which has the letters of each alphabetical section on the left hand side as you scroll.

Example of the forked code running:

## Installation

Currently this is not hosted anywhere, except right here. If there is any interest, I'd be happy to get it hosted somewhere to be able to be installed much easier.

For now, the process I am using is...

1. Open the project in Android studio
1. Create the `jar` (see screenshots below for more info):
    * Option 1: Select the `createJar` option from the run options
    ![Create jar from run menu](https://i.imgur.com/LLtXuge.png "Create jar from run menu")
    * Option 2: Open up the `Gradle project` panel, navigate to `:library` -> `Tasks` -> `other` -> `createJar` and double click that)
    ![create jar from gradle project sidebar panel](https://i.imgur.com/rpEFmb9.gif "create jar from gradle project sidebar panel")
1. Import/add the jar into your own Android Studio project. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35241990/1554860) on how to do this.

## sticky-headers-recyclerview


This decorator allows you to easily create section headers for RecyclerViews using a
LinearLayoutManager in either vertical or horizontal orientation.

Credit to [Emil Sj√∂lander](https://github.com/emilsjolander) for creating StickyListHeaders,
a library that many of us relied on for sticky headers in our listviews.

Here is a quick video of it in action (click to see the full video):

Usage
-----

There are three main classes, `StickyRecyclerHeadersAdapter`, `StickyRecyclerHeadersDecoration`,
and `StickyRecyclerHeadersTouchListener`.

`StickyRecyclerHeadersAdapter` has a very similar interface to the `RecyclerView.Adapter`, and it
is recommended that you make your `RecyclerView.Adapter` implement `StickyRecyclerHeadersAdapter`.

There interface looks like this:

```java
public interface StickyRecyclerHeadersAdapter<VH extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder> {
  public long getHeaderId(int position);

  public VH onCreateHeaderViewHolder(ViewGroup parent);

  public void onBindHeaderViewHolder(VH holder, int position);

  public int getItemCount();
}
```

The second class, `StickyRecyclerHeadersDecoration`, is where most of the magic happens, and does
not require any configuration on your end.  Here's an example from `onCreate()` in an activity:

```java
mRecyclerView = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.recyclerview);
mAdapter = new MyStickyRecyclerHeadersAdapter();
mRecyclerView.setAdapter(mAdapter);
mRecyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(context));
mRecyclerView.addItemDecoration(new StickyRecyclerHeadersDecoration(mAdapter));
```

`StickyRecyclerHeadersTouchListener` allows you to listen for clicks on header views.
Simply create an instance of `StickyRecyclerHeadersTouchListener`, set the `OnHeaderClickListener`,
and add the `StickyRecyclerHeadersTouchListener` as a touch listener to your `RecyclerView`.

```java
StickyRecyclerHeadersTouchListener touchListener =
    new StickyRecyclerHeadersTouchListener(recyclerView, headersDecor);
touchListener.setOnHeaderClickListener(
    new StickyRecyclerHeadersTouchListener.OnHeaderClickListener() {
      @Override
      public void onHeaderClick(View header, int position, long headerId) {
        Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Header position: " + position + ", id: " + headerId,
            Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
      }
    });
mRecyclerView.addOnItemTouchListener(touchListener);
```

The StickyHeaders aren't aware of your adapter so if you must notify them when your data set changes.

```java
    mAdapter.registerAdapterDataObserver(new RecyclerView.AdapterDataObserver() {
      @Override public void onChanged() {
        headersDecor.invalidateHeaders();
      }
    });
```

If the Recyclerview's layout manager implements getExtraLayoutSpace (to preload more content then is
visible for performance reasons), you must implement ItemVisibilityAdapter and pass an instance as a
second argument to StickyRecyclerHeadersDecoration's constructor.
```java
    @Override
    public boolean isPositionVisible(final int position) {
        return layoutManager.findFirstVisibleItemPosition() <= position
            && layoutManager.findLastVisibleItemPosition() >= position;
    }
```


Item animators don't play nicely with RecyclerView decorations, so your mileage with that may vary.

Compatibility
-------------

API 11+

Known Issues
------------

* The header views aren't recycled at this time.  Contributions are most welcome.

* I haven't tested this with ItemAnimators yet.

* The header views are drawn to a canvas, and are not actually a part of the view hierarchy. As such, they can't have touch states, and you may run into issues if you try to load images into them asynchronously.
